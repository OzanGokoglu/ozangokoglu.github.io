  <h1 style="color: #ff3300;">StenoBlog, Just Another Blog, But Written in Shorthand!!</h1>
 <pre>
    I have been thinking about starting a blog written in shorthand, or a StenoBlog. Mostly Orthic, and maybe some Gregg
 here and there. I can't write in a Turkish system yet, although I have been working on developing my own system for Turkish, so 
 the blog will mostly be in English. I think thanks to this I will become more consistent in writing. I am not sure how often I 
 will update the Stenoblog for now. But hopefully it will not be just another dead project of mine. I would love to merge my regular
 blog with this one too, but I probably can't since it is in Turkish and I am too lazy to translate everything I write in that blog,
 so this will just be my blog in English, and my Turkish blog will completely be separate from it. Let's see how it goes.
